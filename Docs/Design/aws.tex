\subsection{AWS}
The class `aws' will be the primary handler of the application's interaction with Amazon Web Services (AWS),
this includes Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). The application
can use the `aws' class to get a list of all available files as well as the ability too download said files, 
given that the user has access to do both.

\subsubsection{Associations}
\textbf{Main} \\
	The AWS class is contained in `Files' view, which will pass in authentication information and receive information about files 
	that a user has access to as well as give them the ability to download files.

\textbf{AWS} \\
	The AWS Class makes calls to Amazon Web Services using Amazon's boto3 Python module.

\subsubsection{Attributes}
\textbf{aws\_ec2\_client\_flow:Object boto3.client()} \\
    This is an instance of the EC2 client, generated by the authentication() method using boto3.client(). Uses access\_key, access\_key\_id, and the region (by default, the region is set to 'us-west-2'). 

\textbf{aws\_s3\_client\_flow:Object boto3.client()} \\
    This is an instance of the S3 client, generated by the authentication() method using boto3.client(). Uses access\_key, access\_key\_id, and the region (by default, the region is set to 'us-west-2').

\textbf{aws\_s3\_resource\_flow:Object boto3.resource()} \\
    This is an instance of the S3 resource, generated by the authentication() method using boto3.resource() method. Uses access\_key, access\_key\_id, and the region (by default, the region is set to 'us-west-2').

\textbf{aws\_download\_path:String=``C:/Downloads''} \\
    This attribute will hold the path value used for downloading files. The default for this attribute will be the downloads folder. The user 
    will be given the option to specify the download location. This will update the value to their new destination. If the destination does 
    not exist, the user will be prompted.

\subsubsection{Methods}
\textbf{aws\_init} \\
    This method passes a AWS access key and AWS access key\_id to Amazons boto3 module, which is used to interact with AWS through python. The key 
    and keyID will be used to create three class attributes that will be used throughout the aws class. These are s3\_client, ec2\_client, s3\_resource.
    
\textbf{aws\_get\_image\_list:json} \\
    Using the \_ec2\_client defined in the \_\_init\_\_ method, the `get\_image\_list' method will be used to retrieve all available files that the user 
    has access to. This will use the client.describe\_images method as defined in the boto3 specifications. This method is used by the Files view.

\textbf{aws\_get\_buckets:json} \\
    Using the \_s3\_client defined in the \_\_init\_\_  method, the `get\_buckets' method will be used to retrieve all available buckets that the user 
    has access to.

\textbf{aws\_list\_images\_in\_bucket:json} \\
    Uses \_s3\_resource to list all images contained within a bucket, this method will return a JSON dict.

\textbf{aws\_export\_to\_bucket} \\
    This method is optionally used and gives a developer the ability to export images to a bucket.

\textbf{aws\_download\_images} \\
    This method will use the \_s3\_resource.download\_file() method within a for loop specified within the Files view to download all selected images.
