\subsection{Authentication}
The \textbf{Authentication} class is a view in the MVC design pattern that will retrieve the user's
credentials for a cloud platform.

\subsubsection{Associations}

\subsubsection{Attributes}
\textbf{fields: String Vector} \\
The \textbf{fields} attribute is a list of field names that the application will create and prompt the user
for. For example, there could be a \textit{user name} field and a \textit{password} field or a \textit{
client\_secret} token or any other variable number of fields needed that the \textbf{Authentication} class
will need to present to the user.

\subsubsection{Methods}
\textbf{authenticate(user\_input: String Vector): Boolean} \\
The method \textbf{authenticate} takes in the filled in fields from the user and sends those back to the
\textbf{Main} class. The \textbf{Main} class will reply with \textit{True} if the authentication was a
success, allowing the application to move onto the next view. If the credentials did not work for
authentication then \textit{False} will be returned and the \textbf{Authenticate} view will re-prompt the user
for their credentials.
