----- TODO List From Design Doc Review -----

Give application catchy name and change everywhere

Don't force self into design pattern like mvc, do what needs to be done

for presentations have pc or something to show larger diagrams

----DONE explain "style"/conventions for the template class (we do it in data dictionary but add to architecture section before uml)

make it more clear on the "workflow" (like changing platform halfway through)

fix UML to actually conform to uml notation (in, out, inout)

----DONE make another diagram with all the json associations
----DONE diagram readability

----DONE in "main" uml diagram, drop methods and attributes

better names (like the template class) -> explain that platforms come off template & template is provided for future maintainers

----DONE fix LaTeX (there's \textbf[])

use font's like italics instead of ? in template

remove python shit from design -> language implementation has nothing to do with design

for future presentions make slideshow

----DONE design doc should have drawup or diagram of views
