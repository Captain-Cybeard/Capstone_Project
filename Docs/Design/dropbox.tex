\subsection{Dropbox}
This class is used in the Resiliency Platform Tool to assist users in the download of selected Dropbox files.
It will connect to the user interface and allow them to log into their Dropbox through a redirect. After logging
in, they will have a list view of the contents of their Dropbox. Per Dropbox's api, some files may be locked and 
not displayed. Using a check box the user will be prompted to select unique files, or to select all. Upon clicking 
the download button, the files will be sent to the C:/Downloads folder, unless specified by the user to change.

\subsubsection{Associations}

\textbf{Makes calls to Dropbox} \\

\subsubsection{Attributes}
\textbf{dropbox\_api\_key:String} \\
    This attribute will store the value of the Api key generated by the Dropbox application development software 
    in order to interact with dropbox's SDK provided for python. Without the key, the Api calls will fail during 
    the authentication process. This attribute is private and stored within the class itself, generated by an Api
    key file included within the website.

\textbf{dropbox\_api\_secret:String} \\
    This attribute will store the value of the Api secret that is generated by the Dropbox application development
    software. It will be used to interact with the Dropbox SDK for python, allowing easier management of the Oauth2
    interface. This attribute is private and stored within the class itself, generated by the Api key file included 
    within the website.

\textbf{dropbox\_authentication\_auth\_flow:Object} \\
    This attribute is an object that is created by the Dropbox SDK, the formal definition of this object is 
    dropbox.oauth.DropboxOAuth2FlowNoRedirect(). This object will be generated, with parameters of both the Api key
    and the Api secret. Once the object is stored local to the class, the Oauth2 flow can start. For now, the NoRedirect
    function is being called. When implemented into the website itself, this will be changed to Redirect, allowing the 
    user to log into their Dropbox within the browser. 

\textbf{dropbox\_authentication\_authorize\_url:String} \\
    This attribute stores the url that is generated by the dropbox\_authentication\_auth\_flow Object, allowing the user
    to be redirected to the Dropbox log-in. The result of which will generate a key value to be passed back into the application
    to complete the validation of the user. Additionally, when the class is integrated into the full website, this will be replaced
    with the redirect url to allow the same operation for validating the user.

\textbf{dropbox\_authentication\_auth\_code:String} \\
    This attribute stores the returned authorization code generated from the dropbox\_authentication\_authorize\_url link. When
    prompted the user will enter the string returned by visiting the link. This will be stored locally to allow the class to use the
    string in the finish() method of the Auth Flow Object. 

\textbf{dropbox\_authentication\_oauth\_result:Object} \\
    This attribute will store the object generated by dropbox\_authentication\_auth\_flow.finish() call. This attribute is used upon validating
    the user when creating the main Dropbox interaction object. Allowing the software to interact directly to the users Dropbox storage, 
    which will be used in the below functions to manage Dropbox files, and folders for the user to select and then download. 

\textbf{dbx:Object} \\
    This attribute is the main Dropbox object. Generated after the authentication, creating access to the users Dropbox. The methods contained 
    within this object will be used in the methods listed below. Which will interact with the Dropbox Api to gather the users files and folders.
    Then process the download for the objects. 

\textbf{dropbox\_get\_files\_return:Object} \\
    This attribute stores the result from the Dropbox api method dropbox.dropbox.Dropbox.files\_list\_folder(). Storing the object 
    dropbox.files.Metadata() generated by the api call. This data will then be stored individually to allow the user to look through 
    files and select the chosen to be downloaded.

\textbf{dropbox\_get\_files\_list\_result:Object List} \\
    This attribute stores the result from the Dropbox api method dropbox.dropbox.Dropbox.files\_list\_folder().entries. Storing the metadata for 
    the various files that are gathered through the Api call. The metadata will include the file name, and extension. The full path to the file, 
    which will be used when the user selects the items in which they want to download, and a parent shared id, which will not be used in this 
    implementation.

\textbf{dropbox\_entries\_to\_download\_list:Object List} \\
    This attribute will store the information provided by the user of which files they want to download. The object is the same as the above 
    attributes. Using the entries.path\_lower, attribute of the generated object, the information will be provided to the download method in 
    order to download the list of files specified by the user.

\textbf{dropbox\_download\_path:String="C:/Downloads"} \\
    This attribute will hold the path value used for downloading files. The default for this attribute will be the downloads folder. The user 
    will be given the option to specify the download location. This will update the value to their new destination. If the destination does 
    not exist, the user will be prompted.

\subsubsection{Methods}
\textbf{dropbox\_authentication:void} \\
    This method implements the authentication pattern user by the Dropbox Python SDK. This method will generate an authorization\_flow object
    that will then generate a url link when instantiated. The user will then provide credentials for the link and copy to authorization\_key 
    to be passed into the program. When integrated into the website, this will cause a redirect to a Dropbox login then load the key without 
    user interaction. After a valid key is provided, given no error is displayed to the user, the key will be stored in a dbx attribute, detailed 
    above.  

\textbf{dropbox\_get\_files\_list:void} \\
    This method uses the dbx attribute generated after authorization of the Dropbox python SDK has completed. Using a method from the dbx object
    dbx.files\_list\_folder() with the arguments, "" to indicate root access, and recursive=True, to allow iteration through the entire Dropbox
    folder system. The call will return and object that will be stored in the dropbox\_get\_files\_listing. Which is then parsed, and placed into
    based off of the entries attribute of the object, and stored locally in dropbox\_get\_files\_list\_result. The method will then iterate through
    the entries, attribute of the object returned, and store them in a List to later be manipulated by the class.

\textbf{dropbox\_format\_entries\_list:void} \\
    This function uses the local dropbox\_get\_files\_list\_result to sort the data and reorganize it. The ordering will be a hierarchal order, listing 
    folders and the included subfolders and files. This will then be stored in JSON format to be used by the website to display the data in an
    accordion list which will expand the structures to display subfolders and files included within selected folder. Providing an easier to manage
    interface for the user.

\textbf{dropbox\_select\_entries\_to\_download:void} \\
    This method will be used to store the indices selected by the user for the files they wish to download. Using key values generated through 
    the UI to then create a new list Dropbox\_entries\_to\_download\_list in which the selections will be saved local to the class.

\textbf{dropbox\_download\_selected\_entries:void} \\
    This method will use the dbx.files\_download\_to\_file(). It will use the locally saved attribute dropbox\_entries\_to\_download\_list to
    iterate through, calling the Api using the user defined dropbox\_download\_path. The function will then download all the files within the 
    list, to the location specified. The user will be prompted with an error if a file is not downloadable, or if a download failed for other 
    reasons.
