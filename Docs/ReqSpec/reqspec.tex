    % What the rest of the document has (sections)
		
    \section{Background}
    % About Cypherpath and their resiliency platform
    % Explain what this application is supposed to solve at a high, nontechnical level

    \section{Overview}
    % How the application will solve the problem, what environment it will run in, language, platform, etc
    % Overview of what it will do

    \section{Environment}
    The environment that the software will preside in consists of modules to interact with \textbf{VMWare}, 
    \textbf{AWS}, other virtual machine platforms and will also be interacting with authentication modules for those
    various platforms. The user will interact with the API's of these cloud services and authentication
    methods through a Django Web App. Lastly, the environment will consist of the application storing the selected
    virtual machines onto the user's local machine.
