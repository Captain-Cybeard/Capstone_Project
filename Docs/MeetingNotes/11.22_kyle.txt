Showing of prototype and first draft of requirements.

Prototype:
    Should authentication be a popup or on its own page? -> doesn't matter, whichever works

    Any more or less details on the files? -> that looks like a good start

    Need to have multi-select for the files and a "select all" button. Don't just assume to select them all.

    Login page (for the application not the cloud platforms) is just a formality, no special requirements.
    Can have it in or take it out.


Requirements stuff:
    Resiliency copies and runs the VM's

    html & css will be stripped out, only backend matters, should specify that in requirements
