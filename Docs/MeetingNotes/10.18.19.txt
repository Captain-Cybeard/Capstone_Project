Specific class interfaces for modules?
    No specific requirements as long is its the same

Keep auth token and if so how long?
    Keep it, server has a ttl

Leave database as SQLite, doesn't sound like anything will be put in it

Admin page doesn't need to do anything, just leave it alone

Restful API was mentioned. It may help with authentication.
