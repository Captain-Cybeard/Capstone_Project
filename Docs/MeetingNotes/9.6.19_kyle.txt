First Meeting

Making a webapp to authenticate to VMware & AWS then list available images to download.
Citrix, Google Drive, Dropbox added later, maybe use OpenID.

They are more interested in authentication part and interfacing with API's.

Environment -> basic Django Server

User Flow:
user logs in (optional?)
user inputs a URL to their VM's, app figures out what service it is (AWS, VMware, etc)
    or if it cant, it asks the user
user now authenticates to the externel service, we possibly store token for repeated use
use is presented with a list of available downloads, distinguish between folders/files.
    Support filesystem nagivation
user can multiselect files/folders, possibly drag 'n drop.

Cypherpath uses Typescript instead of Javascript
