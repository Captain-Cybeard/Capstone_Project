Don't worry about retaining a history of visited VM's for now, focus on the core functionality.

Use Django User's model to have the users log into the application itself. Don't bother with user admin pages
or anything, just create a test user or two on the CLI.

Store user name, email and address don't need to have anything else. The user is just a formality.

SDK's may be overkill and make all sorts of calls and things you don't need, you may need to go through the SDK code
and find the function calls inside that you need and take those out. But if we have to use the whole SDK then that is
fine.

Will be downloading the entire virtual disk image, not snapshots or "junk files" for now.

Once that is working if we can then we may want to "chunk" downloads instead of a stream for several advantages, then
if we really want to we can have a "smart" algorithm for dynamic chunk sizing.
