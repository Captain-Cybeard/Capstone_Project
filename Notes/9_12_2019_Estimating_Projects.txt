			  Estimating
--------------------------------------------------------------

Estimating time and schedule is an important part of project
   planning.

After scope of project has been decomposed into major functions 
   to be performed by application and software engineering 
   process has been selected, estimates of time can be determined
   by project manager with assistance of SW development team.

Can Organize this information in form of table, where SW 
   development tasks to be performed are listed under activities 
   of selective SW development process.

No attempt is made at this point to indicate duration over which 
   estimate time to complete a task will be spread.

This will be accomplished lonter on by expanding table into a 
   schedule.

Large estimated time --> should decompose tasks further and divide 
   into subtasks.

Suggest decomposing tasks just far enough during project planning 
   to enable responsibility for each task to be assigned to an 
   individual.

Further decomposition of tasks may still be necessary to allow 
   good estimates to be provided.

Don't underestimate!! Be defensive in estimating. Build 
   contingencies into estimates.

Project manager should continually manage expectations by 
   emphasizing that estimates are inexact.

Make customer wait for a good project.
