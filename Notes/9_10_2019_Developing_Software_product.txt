  -------------------------------------------------
          Software Product to be Developed
--------------------------------------------------

From Customer Perspective,
   - What do I get?
   - When will I get it?
   - How much will it cost me?

Scope of Project

Given that detailed information  is unavailable 
   about the product, first step is to determine 
   scope to sufficient level of detail.

To accomplish that, must work with customer to
   understand problem domain well enough to 
   determine purpose of application and context
   within which it will operate

Scope, in addition to context, also includes 
   constraints imposed on application and any 
   performance characteristics required of app.

Scope in project plan is written at a fairly 
   high level in terms customer can understand

Scope also appears in requirements specification,
   decomposed to much greater degree

Scope in project plan is decomposed just enough 
   to develop good estimates of time and schedule

This decomposition is perfomred according to major 
   functions to be delivered by application and 
   the software engineering process to be applied
   in developing it.

             Software Engineering Process
-----------------------------------------------------
Project manage is usually responsible for selecting
   process

In general, project manager should select the soft-
   ware engineering porcess most appropriate for the 
   product to be be developed, the people involved 
   in the project, and the environment within which 
   the sw development team will work.

Once scope is determined and process selected, 
   project may be decomposed into a set of tasks that 
   may be estimated and perfomred to complete project.

        Project, organized to enable completion
-----------------------------------------------------
Projects can fail for a variety of reasons:
   - Developers do not understand needs of customer.
   - Deadlines are unrealistic
   - Developers do not have necessary skills

To avoid these problems, project manager needs to take 
   care in building the right team, and providing them
   with the necessary resources to perform the work 
   throughout the project.

Project manager must set realistic expectations

Project manager must insulate team from management, 
   customers, and users as much as possible to develop 
   software, removing any obstactls to success

Through formal reviews and informal communication with 
   members of team, project manager needs to track 
   progress through development to maintain quality and 
   head off problems before they grow out of control.

Project managers should choose simple solutions whenever
   possible.
