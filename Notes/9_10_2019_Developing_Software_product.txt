  -------------------------------------------------
          Software Product to be Developed
--------------------------------------------------

From Customer Perspective,
   - What do I get?
   - When will I get it?
   - How much will it cost me?

Scope of Project

Given that detailed information  is unavailable 
   about the product, first step is to determine 
   scope to sufficient level of detail.

To accomplish that, must work with customer to
   understand problem domain well enough to 
   determine purpose of application and context
   within which it will oeprate

Scope, in addition to context, also includes 
   constraints imposed on application and any 
   performance characteristics required of app.

Scope in project plan is written at a fairly 
   high level in terms customer can understand

Scope also appears in requirements specification,
   decomposed to much greater degree

Scope in project plan is decomposed just enough 
   to develop good estimates of time and schedule

This decomposition is perfomred according to major 
   functions to be delivered by application and 
   the software engineering process to be applied
   in developing it.

           Software Engineering Process
---------------------------------------------------
Project manage is usually responsible for selecting
   process

In general, project manager should select the soft-
   ware engineering porcess most appropriate for the 
   product to be be developed, the people involved 
   in the project, and the environment within which 
   the sw development team will work.

Once scope is determined and process selected, 
   project may be decomposed into a set of tasks that 
   may be estimated and perfomred to complete project.
